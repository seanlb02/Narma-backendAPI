## What is Narma?

Narma is a one-way messaging application. Messages are sent by simulated users (currently run by company admins) to their followers (public users). 

Content within these messages is general in nature, but is intended to support people struggling with depression, anxiety and addiction. It ranges from comedic internet content, news and current affiars, movie and book reccomendations, dating advice, and mental health resources. Each Narma bot has a unique background and persona, which is translated into the content they message to their Followers.
